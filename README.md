# Linked List in C

This repository contains an implementation of a singly/doubly linked list in the C programming language. It demonstrates the use of dynamic memory allocation, pointers, and fundamental data structure operations.

## Features
- Insert elements at the beginning, end, or specific positions.
- Delete elements by value or position.
- Traverse and display all elements.
- Search for elements within the list.
- Free memory upon deletion or program termination.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Hovsepyan1/Linked-list.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Linked-list
    ```

## Compilation
To compile the program, use `gcc`:
```bash
gcc linked_list.c -o linked_list
```

## Usage
Run the executable:
```bash
./linked_list
```

## File Structure
- `linked_list.c` - Main source code containing the implementation and test cases.
- `linked_list.h` - Header file with function prototypes and data structure definitions.

## Functions
- `void insertAtBeginning()` - Inserts a node at the start.
- `void insertAtEnd()` - Inserts a node at the end.
- `void insertAtPosition()` - Inserts a node at a specified position.
- `void deleteNode()` - Deletes a node by value or position.
- `void displayList()` - Displays all elements in the list.
- `Node* searchNode()` - Searches for an element and returns its pointer.
